      Hi! I'm Logan, an aspiring Software Developer at The Ohio State University.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl mb-2">About Me</h1>
    <p class="indent-8 mb-2">
      I have had a fascination with computers for as long as I can remember, and knew that what I would do when I grew
      up would involve them in some way. Over the course of high school, I was exposed to web development through an
      internship opportunity that allowed for me to grow both as a person and professionally. From here, I have worked
      over the summer in the years following, allowing for me to gain many valuable skills, both in programming and
      outside of it.
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8 mb-2">
      Currently, I am seeking internship opportunities to further broaden my horizons and find a way to bridge the gap
      between my studies and the working world. Through an internship, I desire to see how far my current knowledge will
      bring me, and how much I still need to learn through proving my skills while also learning more about the industry.
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8 mb-5">
      Outside of my coursework and internship work, I am also the vice president of the Waffle House Club at The Ohio
      State University, a position that I've held since 2022. In addition to this, I would describe myself as an avid
      guitar player, with several years of practice.

      I have had an increase in spam coming in through my contact info included on my resume, so I have not publicly
      posted it here. If you want to see my resume or have any questions about any of my projects, feel free to reach
      out through any of my socials below, and I will be glad to help.
