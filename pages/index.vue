      Hi! I'm Logan, an aspiring Software Developer at The Ohio State University.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl mb-2">About Me</h1>
    <p class="indent-8 mb-2">
      I have had a fascination with computers for as long as I can remember, and knew that what I would do when I grew
      up would involve them in some way. Over the course of high school, I was exposed to web development through an
      internship opportunity that allowed for me to grow both as a person and professionally. From here, I have worked
      over the summer in the years following, allowing for me to gain many valuable skills, both in programming and
      outside of it.
    </p>
    <p class="indent-8 mb-5">
      Outside of my coursework and internship work, I am also the vice president of the Waffle House Club at The Ohio
      State University, a position that I've held since 2022. In addition to this, I would describe myself as an avid
      guitar player, with several years of continuous practice.
